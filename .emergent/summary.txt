The previous AI engineer successfully bootstrapped the GrowKro platform from scratch. Initial work focused on setting up the core architecture (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) and implementing the Creator Profile System. Key decisions included prioritizing the aha moment with creator profiles and adapting payment integration from Stripe to Razorpay based on user feedback for the Indian market. The engineer incrementally added features like a subscription-based access model, an extensive admin panel, and rich social media integration with follower validation. The development process involved iterative coding, bug fixing (e.g., CSS syntax, React component placement), and comprehensive backend testing, with frontend verification via screenshots. The engineer diligently followed user requests, including logo updates and detailed feature specifications for the admin panel and highlight packages, while preparing for API key integrations.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with enhancing the Admin Panel. The user requested two specific features:
1.  **Creator data extract option in Excel File**.
2.  **Creator List filter option City & Interest wise**.

The AI engineer acknowledged these requests, stating the next step would be to start by adding the required dependencies and backend APIs. This indicates that the work on these two Admin Panel enhancements is about to commence, focusing on the backend implementation first. Additionally, the  component and its corresponding  file were recently created, indicating a preliminary setup for the Business Owners Section, but full integration and logic are pending.
